# Deep-Fake-video-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect deepfake videos, aiming to identify manipulated media by analyzing visual inconsistencies. With the growing prevalence of deepfake technology, detecting these fabricated videos is crucial for maintaining trust in digital media. This project focuses on building an AI-based solution to automatically detect deepfake content, using various algorithms and machine learning models.

## Features
Deepfake Detection: Identifies whether a video has been altered or manipulated.
Pre-trained Models: Utilizes advanced pre-trained models for video classification and facial recognition.
Real-Time Processing: Supports detection on real-time video streams.
Visualization Tools: Provides tools for visualizing video frames and the model's prediction.

## Results
Below are some example images showcasing the model's performance on deepfake detection. These images illustrate the model's ability to accurately distinguish between real and manipulated content.
